# MyVersionOfBullCowGame
This Console Game i wrote through a tutorial from a udemy course. 

Introduce myself:

First of all, i want to say, this is my first Game i wrote in cpp, I did practice cpp years ago, even in c#.
It is really fun to do, and i want to start over again. 
But this time i won't be shy and show my code. Everybody starts from scratch, so any help to improve will be benefitial. 

I will write Games in UnrealEngine, since it might be a good starting point to keep the interest up for now. I don't like those standart things in most books. So this could be my way of learning. I am quiet a fast learner. As i improve in most cases really fast. 

I am 29 and live in Germany. My thoughts on why i want to be a programmer are reasonable, at least for me. I am a totally nerd, who loves logic and computers. I can't really talk to other in person, as i don't know what to say. With other nerds however i feel more secure, since i can talk the way i do. With that said, it should be clear that any type of computer is for me like a known thing, where other people are from another wordl. xD So i do need to practice both, social skills and programming skills. I prefer last one...

This Game was a fun practice and i will do the next one soon. As i have a fulltime job i only have my sparetime to do it. So i need longer than i would need for some of this.
